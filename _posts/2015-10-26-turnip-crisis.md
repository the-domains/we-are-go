description: 'A shortage of pumpkins has led to calls for people celebrating Halloween to consider using turnips. Wet weather is understood to have hit pumpkin supplies as the vegetable prefers drier weather in the early stage of its cultivation. The Grocer magazine has reported the harvest could be down by as much as 50% because of heavy rain in August.'
